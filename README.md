# UEL Average (MPG) Predictor using Machine Learning

* In this project, I developed a machine learning model using Python to predict **vehicle fuel efficiency (MPG)**.
  The system uses the **Auto MPG dataset from Kaggle** and estimates the UEL average based on vehicle specifications.

## Dataset

* **Source:** Kaggle (Auto MPG Dataset)
* Contains automobile data such as engine size, weight, horsepower, and performance features.

---

## Data Preprocessing

* Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas.
* Handled missing values in the horsepower feature.
* Encoded categorical variables and selected relevant features.
* Applied feature scaling where required.

---

## Model Training

* Used a regression-based machine learning model.
* Split the data into training and testing sets for evaluation.

---

## Model Evaluation

* Evaluated model performance using:

  * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  * R² Score

---

## Results

* The model predicts MPG with reasonable accuracy.
* Vehicle weight and engine displacement have a strong impact on fuel efficiency.

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict fuel efficiency using real-world data.
It highlights skills in data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.
